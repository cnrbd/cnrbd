# Connor Uong ðŸ‘‹


I am a second-year undergraduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science. This page is dedicated to all the code-related projects, practice, and exercises I have done. I am particularly interested in ML/AI and applying them to tackle real-world problems alongside data-driven algorithms.
